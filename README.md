# Hell-Triangle---Challenge

## This is a simple solution proposed to the Hell-Triangle problem.

 You can run it as the Maven project or through the class [Application](../master/src/main/java/com/b2w/challenge/Application.java), entering a text that represents a triangle in the follow format:

```java
[[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]
```

 Or you can use (and even increment) the Junit Theories in the class [HellTriangleTest](../master/src/test/java/com/b2w/challenge/test/HellTriangleTest.java).
 
 ### Attemption: This project use the Lombok library (https://projectlombok.org/). Some IDE'S (like IntelliJ) will requiere the lombok plugin instalation for compile the Getters, Setters and Constructors at real time.
